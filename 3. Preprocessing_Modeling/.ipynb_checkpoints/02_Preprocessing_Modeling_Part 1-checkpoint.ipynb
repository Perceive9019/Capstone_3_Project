    "The general framework we will use to carryout the time series forecasting analysis is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Wrangling: Understanding the Dataset**\n",
    "- Load our dataset into a dataset.\n",
    "- Visualize the data to understand its pattern (e.g., using Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python). - Look for seasonality, trends, and potential outliers.\n",
    "- Check for missing data and decide how we want to handle them (e.g., interpolation, forward-fill, or dropping).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **EDA: Decomposition of the Series**\n",
    "Using the package `statsmodels.tsa.seasonal` in Python, we will decompose our time series into:\n",
    "- Trend component\n",
    "- Seasonal component\n",
    "- Residual component\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us insights into the nature of the patterns in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Stationarity**\n",
    "Most time series forecasting methods assume that the underlying time series is stationary, which means statistical properties like mean, variance, etc., are constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test (`adfuller` function from `statsmodels.tsa.stattools`) and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test (`KPSS`function from `statsmodels.tsa.stattools`).\n",
    "- If the series is non-stationary, we can make it stationary by differencing or taking the log, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Selecting a Model**\n",
    "Below are the models we will use to forecast electricity demand in the UK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A popular model for time series forecasting. We'll need to find optimal parameters (p,d,q) for the model. We can use tools like `auto_arima` in the `pmdarima` library to find the best parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SARIMA** (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). It's a statistical model used for forecasting time series data that exhibit seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prophet**: Developed by Facebook, it's useful for datasets with strong seasonal patterns and multiple seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Training and Validation**\n",
    "- Split the dataset into a training set and a validation (or test) set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the validation set will be used to test its performance.\n",
    "- Fit the selected model to the training data.\n",
    "- Forecast for the validation period and compare the forecasted values with the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "Use metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the accuracy of our forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Forecasting**\n",
    "Once satisfied with the model's performance on the validation set, we can use the entire dataset to train the model and then forecast future consumption or demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Post-processing**\n",
    "Some models might give forecasts that need post-processing. For example, if we log-transformed our data, we'll need to reverse the transformation on our forecasts."
